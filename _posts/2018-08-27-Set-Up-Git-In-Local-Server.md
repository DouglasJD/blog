Generate RSA Key

Create RSA Key

- Go to https://git-scm.com/downloads down load git 
- Run git-bash.exe
- In a bash shell, run
      ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
  <!--more-->
- Associating the key with your email address helps you to identify the key later on. 
  You will a response similar to this:
      xiajiandao@MVINB-HKT MINGW64 /
      $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "Hackett@mvitech.com"
      Generating public/private rsa key pair.
      Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/xiajiandao/.ssh/id_rsa):
- Just press <Enter> to accept the default location and file name. 
- Enter and re-enter a passphrase when promoted.  Remember it as it will be used in below steps
- Two files will be generated
  - id_rsa          <RSA Private Key>
  - id_rsa.pub   <RSA Public Key>

Setup Remote Git Repository in Server - Centos 

- Login as root user
- Install and Configure Git
      yum install git
- you create a git user and a .ssh directory for that user.
      sudo adduser git
      su git
      $ cd
      $ mkdir .ssh && chmod 700 .ssh
      $ touch .ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys
- You just append them to the git userâ€™s authorized_keys file in its .ssh directory: 
      $ cat /tmp/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
- you can set up an empty repository for them by running git init with the --bare option, which initializes the repository without a working directory:
      $ cd ~
      $ mkdir project.git
      $ cd project.git
      $ git init --bare
      Initialized empty Git repository in /srv/git/project.git/



Clone repository in your server

- Download SourceTree tool. 
- Go to Tool-> Add SSH Key 
- Import created private key under c/Users/xiajiandao/.ssh/id_rsa
- Go to File -> Clone/New, clone the remote repository
      1. Source Path = git@remote_server:project.git
      2. Destination Path =  #Choose an local location#
- Click clone.
